# WebScraping
 
This is a web scraping project I completed in 2022. It uses selenium to perform a Depth First Search using the Chrome web driver on the takealot.com website.
The current 'state' of the program is stored in the state.json file and all the different categories are stored in the categories.json file.
The programme's state had to be stored as program restarts are common due to internet connectivity issues and throttling.
final_categories.json contains all the category data from takealot.com as of late 2022 and final_state.json contains the final state of the program.
It should be noted that the books category and all its subcategories are not included. 
This is because the vast majority of the categories on Takealot are book-related ie. an enormous amount of space would have to be used to document them.
