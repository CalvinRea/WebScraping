# WebScraping
 
This is a web scraping project I completed in 2022. It uses selenium to perform a Depth First Search using the Chrome web driver on the takealot.com website.
The current 'state' of the program is stored in the state.json file and all the different categories are stored in the categories.json
The programme's state had to be stored as restarts due to internet connectivity issues and throttling.
The final_state.json and final_categories.json contain all the category data from takealot.com as of late 2022.
It should be noted that the books category and all its subcategories are not included. 
This is because the vast majority of the categories on Takealot are book-related ie. an enormous amount of space would have to be used to document them.
